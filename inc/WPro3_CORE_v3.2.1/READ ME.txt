OTHER USEFUL STUFF!
There is an example of how to create plugins for WysiwygPro located at wysiwygPro/plugins/EXAMPLE/
You can load the EXAMPLE plugin like this:

<?php
include_once('wysiwygPro/wysiwygPro.class.php');
$editor = new wysiwygPro();
$editor->name = 'content';
$editor->value = '<p>Some HTML code..</p>';
$editor->loadPlugin('EXAMPLE');
$editor->display();
?>

You can also get ideas from the other plugins in the wysiwygPro/plugins/ folder.
Many of wysiwygPro's core plugins are located at wysiwygPro/core/plugins/, these plugins
use the same architecture as the regular plugins, they are just located somewhere
different. You can read the source code and get ideas from them too.

We hope you enjoy WysiwygPro 3 as much as we enjoyed developing it for you.
Most of WysiwygPro 3's new features and API are a direct result of feedback from developers like yourself. 
Thank you for making WysiwygPro what it is today!
