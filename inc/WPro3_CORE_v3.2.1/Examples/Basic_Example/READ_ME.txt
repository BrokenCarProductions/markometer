This example shows how to use WysiwygPro.

File descriptions:

index.php
Displays the editor inside a form. The form submits to action.php

action.php
Displays the HTML code submitted from the editor.
In a real application you would probably want to save the submitted html code to a database or file.

To run this example first make sure that the includes in index.php point correctly to the wysiwygPro folder.
