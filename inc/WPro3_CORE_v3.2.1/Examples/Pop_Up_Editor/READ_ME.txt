Pop-Up Editor

This example demonstrates a simple method for adding WysiwygPro editing to an existing HTML form. 

To run this example make sure the includes in edit.php point correctly to the WysiwygPro folder.
Add any extra PHP API calls you require to configure your image directories etc.
Point your browser at the index.htm file to see this in action.

Look at the source for index.htm and edit.php to see how this was done.
