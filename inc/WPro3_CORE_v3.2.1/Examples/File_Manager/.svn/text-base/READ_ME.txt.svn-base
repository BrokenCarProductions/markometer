File_Manager

This demonstrates how to call the image and document managers from an html form and have the selected file returned to a field in your form.

To run this example make sure that all includes in index.php point correctly to the WysiwygPro folder.

Make your images, documents and media folders writable (chmod to 777 using an FTP program)

Add any PHP API calls you require to configure your directories.
