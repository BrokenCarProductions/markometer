<p>A lead category is simply a way to help you quickly evaluate the engagement level of a lead.</p>
<p>We classify them as Hot, Warm, Cool and Cold to help you get an idea of their mindset.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Hot Leads</strong> - Highly qualified and likely to buy soon. They have a budgeted project initiative and will buy from someone, hopefully you. You might also call these "A" Leads.</li>
		<li><strong>Warm Leads</strong> - Qualified and likely to buy sometime. They are interested, but it's very early in their project, which may or may not have budget. You might also call these "B" leads.</li>
		<li><strong>Cool Leads</strong> - Qualified but not sure when or if they'll be buying. They are doing research, but have no immediate need and likely don't have a budgeted project initiative yet. You might also call these "C" leads.</li>
		<li><strong>Cold Leads</strong> - Unqualified and not likely to buy. They have no budget and no project. You might also call these "D" leads.</li>
	</ul>
