<p>Since you're an administrator, you get a slightly different view of the settings page than a normal user.</p>
<p>You'll see links to edit your own personal information (such as your name, email, phone, etc) as well as a link to view and manage other users personal information in the system.</p>
<p>Account owners have even more rights and will see additional boxes where you can update your Master Account information as well as view, add and edit Sub Accounts.</p>
