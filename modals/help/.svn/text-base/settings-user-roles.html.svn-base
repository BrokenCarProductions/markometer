<p>Account/User Roles ensure that people in the system only see what they need to see. Here's a full list of available user roles:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Owner</strong> - The owner has access to do everything in the system. There can only be one account owner per account.</li>
	<li><strong>Admin</strong> - This is the next most powerful role in the system. The administrator has access to do everything in the system except change the Master Account information and add Sub Accounts. There can be multiple administrators per account.</li>
	<li><strong>Marketing</strong> - The marketing role can view and create campaigns, action pages, and forms, as well as track campaign results. There can be multiple marketing roles per account.</li>
	<li><strong>Sales</strong> - The sales role can view and edit all lead information, including adding new leads to the system. They can also create quotes, close sales, and interact with all their leads in the system. There can be multiple sales roles per account.</li>
	<li><strong>Executive</strong> - The executive role can track campaign results, as well as view all lead information. There can be multiple executive roles per account.</li>
	<li><strong>Assign Leads</strong> - The "Assign Leads" function can be added to any user in the system. This gives them the ability to assign a lead or multiple leads to a particular sales person, in addition to their existing role functionality.</li>
	<li><strong>Disable</strong> - "Disable" really isn't a role, it's just a way of telling the system you don't want a user to have any access whatsoever to the account you're specifying.</li>
</ul>
