This example demonstrates how to dynamically configure multiple directories for storing images, media and documents. In this example we configure two folders for images, two for media and two for documents. You could use this feature to give your users a shared images folder and a personal images folder that only they see. Each folder can be given different permissions.

To run this example make sure that all includes in index.php point correctly to the WysiwygPro folder.
Make your images, documents and media folders writable (chmod to 777 using an FTP program)
